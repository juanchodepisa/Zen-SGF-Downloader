# Zen-SGF-Downloader
An SGF downloader for OGS that removes rank information.

## Requirements:

1. Install Python3 on your computer. Make sure that you allow "python" to be added to PATH as an environmental variable during installation.
2. Install the Requests module. Just open a Terminal and type:
```$ python -m pip install requests```
3. Download "Zen SGF Downloader.pyw". It should be pretty much plug-and-play.
